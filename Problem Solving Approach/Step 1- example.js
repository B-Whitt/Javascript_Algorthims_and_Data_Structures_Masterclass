// Write a function which takes two numbers and return their sum
// ===================================================================

//1. Can i restate the problem in my own words ?
/** This mean i need addition **/

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem ?
/** Ints ?
 * Floats
 * Number
 * **/
// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem ?
/** Ints ?
 * Floats
 * Number
 * **/
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do you have enough information to solve the problem  ?
/** Yes i do have enough information **/
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem ?
/** Always use the right naming for the variables **/
