## Description
This course crams months of computer science and interview prep material into 20 hours of video.
The content is based directly on last semester of my in-person coding bootcamps, where my students go on to land 6-figure developer jobs.
We start with the basics and then eventually cover “advanced topics” that similar courses shy away from like Heaps, Graphs,
and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm.
